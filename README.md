**Two Chainz** is a Ruby gem for generating random sentences with [Markov chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).

## Quickstart

``` ruby
require 'two_chainz'

generator = TwoChainz::Generator.new

generator.hear("We just want the credit where it's due")
generator.hear("Imma worry bout me, give a fuck about you")
generator.hear("Just as a reminder to myself")
generator.hear("I wear every single chain even when I'm in the house")

generator.spit(:max_words => 12) # => "We just as a fuck chain even when I'm in the credit"
```
